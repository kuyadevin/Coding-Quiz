[Devin's Quiz](https://kuyadevin.github.io/Coding-Quiz/)


## About
For this projection, I was tasked with making a simple coding quiz that invovles a timer.

## Requirements
- When I hit start, the quiz starts with a timer counting down
- WHen I answer a question I am prompted with another question
- When I answer a question wrong time is taken off of the timer
- When all questions are answered or the timer hits 0 the game is over
- I can save my score and initials

## Use
- To start the quiz, hit the start button
-  the answer you are choosing for each corresponding question

## Code Examples
One of the aspects of the tis project that I am most proud of is the timer. At first I struggled to create it, but go it down eventually. Here is a previerw of the code used for the timer. 

## Challenges
This project was one of the tougher ones I have faced so far. I was having problems with the quiz going from question to question. At the time of writing, I still have not figured out that aspect but plan on fixing.
